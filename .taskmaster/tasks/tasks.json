Optional: slight ring alpha pulse 0.9–1.0 if ringRef available.\n- Debugging ring pulse (startDebugRingPulse): ringRef scale 1.0–1.10 and alpha 0.75–1.0; duration 1000–1300 ms, ease Sine.inOut, yoyo true, repeat -1. Keep body scale at 1 to differentiate from working.\n- Error shake (playErrorShake): interrupt other loops, then tween jitter on x: +/- 4–8 px, 90–120 ms per segment, repeat 4–6, ease Sine.inOut; concurrently flash ringRef tint to error color and alpha to 1.0 in sync with subtask 61.2 ring pulse.

Auto-size the background to the measured text + padding.

Expose configurable auto-reconnect options to the caller: attempts, delay, delayMax, and jitter, mapped to socket.io’s reconnectionAttempts, reconnectionDelay, reconnectionDelayMax, and randomizationFactor (with sensible defaults). On connect_error with 401/unauthorized, force a token refresh via tokenProvider and let the next retry use the updated token through the auth callback, respecting the backoff settings. Enforce single-flight token refresh and continue to avoid duplicate listener registration. Emit a reconnect_failed lifecycle event when max attempts are exhausted.

UI does not consume this yet.\n- Worker sets village.lastSynced to an ISO-8601 timestamp only after all repos/houses processed successfully; do not set on failure. POST /api/villages/:id/sync returns 202 when (re)queued and is safe to call multiple times.\n- Analytics: emit onboarding_sync_poll_start, onboarding_sync_timeout, onboarding_sync_retry, onboarding_enter_auto with villageId and durations.\n- Edge cases: if GET /api/villages/:id returns 404/403, show an inline error with Retry; network errors surface a non-blocking alert and allow retry; if the status endpoint is unavailable, there is no UI impact.\n</info added on 2025-09-15T17:55:15.392Z>\n<info added on 2025-09-15T23:50:50.422Z>\n- Switch to houses-level sync: trigger POST /api/villages/:id/houses/sync on mount (and on retries); treat as idempotent with 202 responses.\n- Polling: every 2s (with exponential backoff on retries: 2s, 4s, 6s, max 10s), fetch both GET /api/villages/:id/houses/sync/status and GET /api/villages/:id. Use status to show progress and village.lastSynced to detect completion.\n- Completion criteria: if status.state === complete OR village.lastSynced is present, mark onboarding finished and route to /village/:id; stop polling on unmount/navigation.\n- Progress UI: while pending/running, show spinner and, when available, \"Syncing houses… X of Y complete\" using status.completed/total alongside the existing copy.\n- Timeout fallback to proceed: after 60s without completion, offer Proceed to Village (continues background sync) alongside Retry. Proceed routes to /village/:id, marks onboarding finished, and shows a non-blocking banner “Still syncing in the background…”. If status.state === failed, still allow Proceed and emphasize Retry.\n- Analytics: emit onboarding_sync_status_poll_start, onboarding_sync_timeout, onboarding_sync_retry, onboarding_enter_auto, and onboarding_sync_proceed_timeout (when Proceed is used after timeout), including villageId and durations.\n</info added on 2025-09-15T23:50:50.422Z>",
