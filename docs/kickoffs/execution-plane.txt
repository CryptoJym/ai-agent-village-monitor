You are Opus Lead Orchestrator.

Goal: run a 3-subagent parallel sprint using Task Master tag: execution-plane.

Repo:
- /Users/jamesbrady/Projects/utlyze/ai-agent-village/canonical/ai-agent-village-monitor

Hard rules:
- Do NOT run task-master init.
- Do NOT hand-edit .taskmaster/*.json (use Task Master CLI only).
- Use branches + PRs (one branch per task).
- Respect file boundaries (no overlap).
- Update Task Master with Plan + Progress + Done notes.

Preflight (run first):
1) cd repo
2) task-master tags use execution-plane
3) task-master validate-dependencies
4) task-master list

Tasks to execute in parallel:

Subagent A (Frontend) — Task #2 "Frontend: start/stop runner session UX"
- Branch: ep-2-runner-session-dev-ui
- Allowed files: packages/frontend/src/**
- Must run tests:
  - pnpm -C packages/frontend test
  - pnpm -C packages/frontend typecheck
- Acceptance:
  - Dev-only panel/button to POST /api/runner/sessions
  - Shows sessionId + live output via existing work_stream_event feed
  - Allows stop + send input
  - Works with E2E_TEST_MODE / dev-auth helper locally

Subagent B (Docs) — Task #3 "Control-plane integration plan + adapter"
- Branch: ep-3-control-plane-integration-plan
- Allowed files: docs/**
- Deliverable: docs/CONTROL_PLANE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- Acceptance:
  - Decide: keep Socket.IO as transport or bridge to control-plane WebSocketServer
  - Document event contract alignment and gaps (file paths + event names)
  - Goal is coherent runtime story, not a full rewrite

Subagent C (Docs) — Task #5 "Spec trace matrix (execution plane)"
- Branch: ep-5-execution-plane-trace-matrix
- Allowed files: docs/**
- Deliverable: docs/EXECUTION_PLANE_TRACE_MATRIX.md
- Acceptance:
  - For AGENT_RUNNER_SPEC + PROVIDER_ADAPTERS_SPEC: list major sections and link to files
  - For runtime glue: document request/response schemas and Socket.IO event mapping
  - Include 'implemented / partial / not started' status per section

For each subagent:
- task-master set-status <id> in-progress
- task-master update-task --append <id> "Plan: <tight plan + acceptance criteria>"
- Implement, commit, push, open PR
- task-master update-task --append <id> "Done: <what changed> | Files: <paths> | Tests: <commands/results>"
- task-master set-status <id> done (or review if you want human verification)

Finally:
- task-master list
- Provide a short summary of what shipped and links to PRs.
