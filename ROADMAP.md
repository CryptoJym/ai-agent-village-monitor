# Roadmap

This project originated from an MVP plan tracked with Task Master.

Near-term focus areas:

- Performance & scalability of WebSockets at scale
- Agent management UX and interoperability
- Plugin ecosystem for providers/tools
- Telemetry with strong privacy controls (DNT/GPC, opt-out)

See `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` and docs/ for detailed milestones.
